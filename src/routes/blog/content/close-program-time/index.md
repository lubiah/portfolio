Out of boredom today, I decided to create a Python application capable of automatically closing other applications at the time specified. This could be a perfect idea for an application (I honestly don't think so:smile:).

For now, I'm going to name the programme "App Killer." Sounds cool, right? 
I'm going to code it in Python. I'm going to use an object-oriented approach since that will be easier than using functional programming.

## How It Will Work

Okay, so the application will be multi-threaded, which means it will execute on multiple threads. The application will request two pieces of information from the user: the name of the programme and its end time. Both will then be processed and run on a separate thread. A function will be executed on each thread to determine when a programme should be terminated. If it should, it terminates the application.

The command `taskkill /IM %application name% /F` will be performed to terminate the application, where `%application name%` is the name of the application to be closed. When the time comes, this command will forcefully close all instances of the application. Isn't it simple?

## Coding The Script

```python
import time as time_module
from threading import Thread
from subprocess import Popen


class AppKiller:
  def __init__(self, name, time):
    self.name = name
    self.time = time

  def get_time(self):
    return str(time_module.strftime("%R"))

  def watch(self):
    def inner_function():
      while self.get_time() != self.time:
        time_module.sleep(2)
      command = Popen(["taskkill","/IM",self.name,"/F"],shell=True)
    Thread(target=inner_function).start()
```

That is the code shown above. It's fairly straightforward. There is an inner function within the `watch` method that checks if the current time is identical to the end time of an app. If it is, the application is terminated. If it isn't, it sleeps for 2 seconds before checking again.

## Using the Script

Now that we are done coding the script, it’s now time to use it. The most suitable way to run this programme was by making it into a CLI tool, but let's just use it the hard-coded way.

So, to make App Killer watch and kill an app, you pass two parameters to its constructor: the app’s executable name and the time at which it is to quit.

So for the example I am going to be making, I am going to kill two apps: Node JS and my Brave browser. NodeJS will close at 08:30 (i.e., 8:30 AM) and Brave Browser will close at 21:21 (i.e., 9:21 PM).

So in our code, we will write:

```python
brave = AppKiller("brave.exe","21:21")
brave.watch()
node_js = AppKiller("node.exe","08:30")
node_js.watch()
```

That's all that is needed to initiate the simple program we created.
Now, when you look at the little snippet I wrote, you will notice that the time `21:21` comes before `08:30`. Since each instance of the `AppKiller` class runs on a different thread, the time won't be affected, that is, `brave.exe` will not close before `node.exe`, they will all close when their time is due since they all run on different threads.

Happy Coding! :smile:
